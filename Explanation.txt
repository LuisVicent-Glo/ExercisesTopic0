Hello, for this challenge I made a program that allows us to use a model to
create printers and create beans for each printer to instantiate
the printers created and for use in a repository
which create the logic by saving those printers and using them in the 
executor class

in the future it will give problems because I tried to use the DI pattern
but when I create the beans is where I have the problem

It's possible to add more printer options but at the moment those
aggregations are manual
